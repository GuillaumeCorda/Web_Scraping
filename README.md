# Web Scraping projects

Some scrapers developed as part of the Data Systems and Information Retrieval courses for the MSc Information Studies at the University of Amsterdam ('18-'19).

## Script

The file **scraper_freight_companies.py** is a snippet of the code we use to scrap information from freight companies websites.

The script **charge_map.py** allows to scrap every electric vehicle charging point from the ChargeMap website ([link]https://fr.chargemap.com/map). You can also enter a random address and get the closest charging points in a given distance around.

## Notebooks

The notebook **scraper_apartments.ipynb** was used to retrieve data from apartments for rent in the Netherlands.
