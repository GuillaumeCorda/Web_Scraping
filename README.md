# Web Scraping projects

Some scrapers developed as part of the Data Systems and Information Retrieval courses for the MSc Information Studies at the University of Amsterdam ('18-'19).

## Script

The file **scraper_freight_companies.py** is a snippet of the code we use to scrap information from freight companies websites.

## Notebooks

The notebook **scraper_apartments.ipynb** was used to retrieve data from apartments for rent in the Netherlands.
